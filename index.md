# Welcome to my data blog

Hello there, welcome to this blog.
We'll mostly talk about data science : from times to times, I'll create a post about something I've been learning in data.

I'm writing this mainly for myself, since it's been proven that writing about a topic helps you learn better, and clear your head about ideas.

But if some content can help others one day, I'll be very glad about it.

Some articles will be in French, others in English
