# Welcome to my data blog

Hello there, welcome to this blog.
We'll mostly talk about data science : from times to times, I'll create a post about something I've been learning in data.

I'm writing this mainly for myself, since it's been proven that writing about a topic helps you learn better, kind of forces you to clear your head about ideas.

But if some content can help others one day, I'll be very glad about it.
