# Small data
We hear a lot about big data.

Accross the 7 projects of my training, I've been working on several hundred thousands, or millions of data instances on various topics.\
That's not exactly big data, but that's something you can apply machine learning to : KNN, linear regression, random forest, ...

But what if you have 150 instances only and 35 variables ? Will machine learning or statistical analysis help you solve your problem ?\
I guess it depends on various things:\
- The nature of variable distributions and the existence of "rare" values that you may miss in your sampling
- The complexity of relation between dependant variables (= features, in machine learning) and independant variables (= labels to predict)
- The amount of effect size
- The number of variables having an effect : 150 instances and 5 variables is completely different from 150 instances and 35 variables
